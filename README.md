## How to Play

1. **Cash System**: By default, you start with $1000. You can bet your cash on each round of the game. The outcome of the round affects your cash balance. If you run out of money, you lose.
2. **Gameplay**: Follow the instructions to play your turn. You will be asked to choose whether to hit or stand. The goal is to get as close to 21 points without going over. If your hand total is closer to 21 than the dealer's, you win. If you go over 21, you bust and lose the round.
